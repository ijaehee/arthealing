### Filters

Our themes package makes use of [Assetic](https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic), a great asset management package for PHP. It makes use of [filters](https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic#filters) (for which there are [many tutorials available](http://www.slideshare.net/kriswallsmith/introducing-assetic-asset-management-for-php-53)).

Our themes package simplifies asset handling by applying filters across all assets with a given extension. We are looking towards supporting filters per-asset in a future version of our Themes package as well for even further flexibility.

When [configuring](/themes-2/configuration) themes you may specify any filters which automatically get applied to assets with a given file extension.

Simple, no bloat. That's the way we love it.
