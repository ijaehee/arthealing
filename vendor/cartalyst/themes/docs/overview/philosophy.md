### Philosophy

When developing themes, we set out to tackle a common problem with working in development teams. There are two kinds of people who work on a website:

1. Developers
2. Designers

We love creating packages which are both developer-centric as well as designer-friendly. The only way to do this properly is keep a good separation of concerns.

Backend developers aren't great with design (because let's face it, backend developers would rather just "Twitter Bootstrap" every site they work on).

Frontend designers don't want to tackle with complex PHP code.

For this reason, we wanted to keep all asset handling within views and not in controllers or configuration files.
